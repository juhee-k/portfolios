# Juhee Kim's React Portfolio
I am contents creator with a background in Digital Media, Graphic Design, Video, and Full Stack Development! Iâ€™ve created more than 300 websites by using Wordpress, Dreamweaver, AEM and other CMS tools. I also wanted to study more about full stack development and took the classes though UCLA Bootcamp. So, I have the knowledge and skills of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so forth. I enjoy creating an organized environment and creating ways to increase efficiency and productivity in the workplace.

My portfolio site has the sites that I have built with html/css, Java Script, React, Wordpress, Wix, Duda and as well as the brochure, flyer, buisess cards that were created by using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I have done more than portfolios and pretty sure that I will make more and better!
